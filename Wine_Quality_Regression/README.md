# 💎 Diamonds Price Prediction 
This project was a part of tasks fors the IEEE -ML-2025 track. 
The objective was to predict the price of diamonds using regression techniques with and without regularization to experiment with the concept.

## 📌 Project Objectives :
- Understand the Data and explore it
- Preform Exploratory data Analysis
- Clean and Preprocess data for modeling
- Train, evaluate and compare (Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, ElasticNet moels)
- Summerize Findings

## 📊 Dataset Description

- **Source**: [Kaggle Diamonds Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivam2503/diamonds)
- **Features**: Physical attributes of diamonds such as carat, cut, clarity, color, depth, table, and dimensions (x, y, z).
- **Target**: price

## 📊 Metrics Evaluated
Each model was compared using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared (R²)
- Adjusted R-squared (R²_adj)
